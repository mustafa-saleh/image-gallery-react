# Watson Text to Speech Voices

The IBM Watsonâ„¢ Text to Speech service provides APIs that use IBM's
speech-synthesis capabilities to convert written text to natural-sounding
speech. The service streams the synthesized audio back to the client with
minimal delay. The audio uses appropriate cadence and intonation for its
language and dialect to provide voices that are smooth and natural.

The service can be used in applications such as voice-automated chatbots, as
well as a variety of voice-driven and screenless applications, such as tools for
the disabled or visually impaired, video narration and voice over, and
educational and home-automation solutions. It is appropriate for any application
where audio is the preferred method of output. For more information please visit
